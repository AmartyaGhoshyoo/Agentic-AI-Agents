      n### How MSGM designers used Pixel features\n\nTo develop the     
      line\u2019s unique patterns, we provided MSGM's designers with    
      Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices. The featured images on the       
      clothes were shot around the Milan underground area using Long    
      Exposure Mode and edited using Magic Editor.\n\nLong Exposure Mode
      uses Pixel's AI camera technology to creatively add blur to       
      capture the energy of the scene in front of you \u2014 simulating 
      a traditional long exposure that blurs the motion of moving       
      objects. Achieving this effect on traditional cameras typically   
      requires a tripod, but our engineers found ways to make this more 
      accessible to everyone and stabilize Motion Mode                  
      shots.\n\n![Person standing behind the yellow line of an          
      underground metro station as a metro passes them by. The metro is 
      then blurred with Pixel AI                                        
      features.](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-pro
      d/original_images/Subway_Motion_Mode_720-min_08hwHxn.gif)\n\nThe  
      images taken with Long Exposure Mode were then edited on the phone
      with Magic Editor. With Magic Editor, you can make complex edits  
      without pro-level skills. Using a combination of AI techniques,   
      including generative AI, the feature helps you make edits to      
      specific parts of an image \u2014 in this case, objects in an     
      underground metro station \u2014 so you have even more control    
      over the final look and feel of your photo.\n\n![T images. The    
      first is a picture of an underground metro station shot with      
      Pixel\u2019s Long Exposure mode. The metro is blurry and you can  
      see through it. The second is the same picture of the underground 
      but the objects are moved around using Magic Editor and the third 
      is an image of a male model wearing the MSGM tank top with the    
      second pattern applied to

      es/MSGM_x_Pixel_evolution.width-100.format-webp.webp)\n\nThe Pixel
      devices became an essential partner for MSGM, offering a suite of 
      AI-powered tools that allowed the designers to fully express their
      creativity. \u201cCelebrating the intersection of fashion and     
      technology is like a journey through digital time, a collection   
      that reflects on the speed of our era,\u201d says MSGM founder    
      Massimo Giorgetti. \u201cMSGM and Google Pixel converge to create 
      not just clothes, but an expression of contemplation on the       
      digital and the lost time we wish to redeem. Each piece is a      
      fragment of digital memory, a nod to the past and a leap into the 
      future. The collaboration extends beyond fabrics and              
      stitches.\"\n\nExplore the MSGM x Google Pixel 8 Capsule

      Editor, which allows users to make detailed edits without         
      professional skills. Designers captured the energy of Milan’s     
      underground via Long Exposure, then refined the images with Magic 
      Editor, resulting in unique patterns for clothing. This innovative
      partnership merges fashion and technology, emphasizing digital    
      creativity and future-forward design. Each piece reflects a
