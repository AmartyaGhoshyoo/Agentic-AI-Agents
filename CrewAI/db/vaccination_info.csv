Question,Answer
What is vaccination and immunization?,"Vaccination is a process in which killed or modified disease-causing germs are introduced into the body, commonly by injections, but also by oral route and nasal sprays. It's a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting babies against harmful diseases before they come in contact with the germs. Vaccination uses the body's natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes the immune system stronger. Vaccines reduce the risk of complications and mortality following exposure to an infectious agent. In this way, the vaccinated person develops immunity against the specific disease-causing germ."
Why are vaccines important?,"Vaccines have changed our perception about infectious diseases. Infections that were considered a curse for mankind have reduced considerably due to vaccines. Smallpox has been eradicated, polio is present only in two countries, and diseases like measles, rubella, diphtheria, and pertussis have declined considerably. We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases. Immunization currently prevents 3.5-5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, and measles. Immunizations are also one of the best health investments money can buy, protecting individuals, communities, and economies from the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable disease threats."
What do vaccines contain?,"Vaccines contain several components:

Antigen: the most active part of the vaccine
Adjuvant: chemicals which enhance the immune response of the antigen
Preservatives: prevent germs from growing in the vaccine vial e.g., Thiomersal
Stabilizers: chemicals which maintain the potency of the vaccine during manufacturing and transport
Surfactants: chemicals which prevent the vaccine particles from sticking to each other
Residuals: chemicals which are left over after the final purification process, including antibiotics"
How do vaccines work?,"Vaccines work like superheroes for a child's health by training the immune system to fight off dangerous germs. They trick the immune system into believing that the actual disease-causing germs have entered the body. When a vaccine is introduced, the immune system interacts with the germs in the vaccine and produces proteins known as antibodies, which act against the germs in the vaccine. Certain cells get programmed to remember this exposure. When the actual germ enters the body again, these specialized memory cells get activated and produce large quantities of antibodies that surround and kill the germs, thus preventing disease in the vaccinated person."
What are the different types of vaccines?,"Vaccines are made using several processes and may contain:
- Live viruses or bacteria that have been attenuated (weakened or altered so as not to cause illness). Examples include Chicken pox and Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccines.
- Inactivated or killed organisms or viruses. Examples include Inactivated Polio vaccine and Conjugate Typhoid vaccines.
- Inactivated toxins made into toxoid vaccines (e.g., Tetanus and Diphtheria).
- Segments of the pathogen, containing specific proteins or sugars found on the surface. Examples: Hib and Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.
- Genetic material (mRNA or DNA), e.g., Covid vaccines by Pfizer, Moderna (mRNA), ZyCoV-D (DNA)."
How are vaccines developed and tested before being used?,"Each vaccine undergoes rigorous testing in multiple phases:
- Exploratory: identifies parts of organism useful for vaccine
- Pre-Clinical: lab and animal testing
- Phase I: small human trials (20–50)
- Phase II: few hundred people for dosing/safety
- Phase III: thousands of volunteers
- Phase IV: post-market monitoring
At each step, safety is paramount; unsafe vaccines never proceed."
Are vaccines safe?,"Yes. Vaccines go through multiple safety assessments including lab tests and three clinical trial phases. After public use, they are monitored continuously for rare effects. Minor side effects (e.g., swelling, fever) are common; serious allergic reactions are extremely rare (1–2 per million). Claims linking vaccines to autism, allergies, or diabetes are scientifically disproved."
What are vaccine schedules?,"A vaccine schedule outlines when and how often a child should receive vaccinations. It considers age, timing between doses, and the number of doses needed. India follows two schedules: National Immunization Program (NIP) and Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP). Delayed schedules don’t need to restart; just continue the remaining doses."
Why do children need so many vaccines at such a young age?,"Infections are more dangerous in early life. Infants have low natural immunity, so early vaccinations help protect against diseases that could cause serious complications in young children."
Why do children need multiple doses of the same vaccine?,"Infants have immature immune systems, so initial responses to vaccines are weak. Multiple doses help build strong and lasting immunity. For some diseases like diphtheria and tetanus, immunity wanes over time, needing booster shots."
Will giving so many vaccines overload my baby's immune system?,No. Babies can handle exposure to many antigens at once. The immune system is capable of managing multiple vaccines safely and effectively without being overwhelmed.
Is the mercury in vaccines safe?,Yes. The mercury compound used (Thiomersal) prevents contamination in multi-dose vials. Large studies confirm no link between this form of mercury and brain damage or autism. It is safe in small doses used in vaccines.
Is aluminum in vaccines safe?,"Yes. Aluminum helps boost the immune response. It's commonly found in food, water, and air. The amount in vaccines is minimal and not harmful to health."
Does the MMR vaccine cause autism?,"No. The claim was based on a flawed 1998 study, which was retracted by *The Lancet*. Extensive research has disproven any connection between MMR and autism."
Why do some children develop diseases despite being vaccinated?,"No vaccine is 100% effective. A few individuals may not develop sufficient immunity even after vaccination. However, vaccines protect the vast majority (95%+), making them highly effective overall."
Can you get a disease from the vaccine that's supposed to prevent it?,"Live attenuated vaccines (e.g., oral polio) may rarely cause illness due to mutation. Such events are extremely rare and are outweighed by the benefits of vaccination."
Do I need to be vaccinated against diseases not present in my community or country?,"Yes. Germs can travel across borders. If you’re not vaccinated and travel or are exposed to a traveler carrying the infection, you can still get sick. Global travel makes protection essential."
Why should I vaccinate my child against a mild illness like chickenpox?,"Chickenpox can disrupt school and work, spread to others, and cause severe complications in immune-compromised individuals. Vaccination prevents transmission and serious consequences."
"Are vaccines just for children, or do adults need them too?","Adults also need vaccines. Immunity can fade, and new vaccines may not have been available when they were children. Older adults are at higher risk from diseases like flu and pneumonia. Boosters and adult vaccines are important."
Is it safe to give my child extra doses of vaccines given in campaigns?,"Yes. Extra doses during campaigns (e.g., Pulse Polio, MR) are safe and necessary for public health. They enhance population immunity and prevent disease outbreaks, even for already vaccinated children."
Why do private providers offer vaccines not available in the Government's program?,The government offers vaccines based on public health priorities and cost-effectiveness for large populations. Private providers may offer newer or additional vaccines not yet part of the national program but still safe and effective.
